# How to build an exe for Windows

It can be very useful to distribute and exe on Microsoft Windows platforms. By the way, you can freeze an executable on all platforms. But the following lines are for Windows platform.

You will need [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) !

## A "light" one, with the need of chrome on the host

(Who doesn't have chrome on its computer ?!)

If yours users have chrome installed. It's the best option : the exe will reuse the installed chrome in "app mode". The exe will be lighter (6mo min)

It's the best option for `app.run()` or `app.serve()` modes in your main py file.

    pyinstaller.exe YourGuyApp.py --noupx --onefile --noconsole --exclude-module cefpython3 --add-data="static;static"

Notes:

- `noupx` : because, with upx it gives me errors ;-)
- `onefile` : to embed all needed runtime files.
- `noconsole` : like you want ...
- `exclude-module cefpython3` : So you will need to have chrome on the host machine to be able to run the exe.
- `add-data="static;static"` : to embed yours static file for rendering (css, images ...)

## A full one ; all included

If you target an unknow windows computer, perhaps you should embed a chrome in the exe. It's possible with [cefpython3](https://pypi.org/project/cefpython3/) module.

Install cefpython

    python3 -m pip install cefpython3

And change your `app.run()` into `app.runCef()` in your main py file.

    pyinstaller.exe YourGuyApp.py --noupx --onefile --noconsole --add-data="static;static"

Notes:

- your exe will be bigger (60mo min)
- `noupx` : because, with upx it gives me errors ;-)
- `onefile` : to embed all needed runtime files.
- `noconsole` : like you want ...
- `add-data="static;static"` : to embed yours static file for rendering (css, images ...)
